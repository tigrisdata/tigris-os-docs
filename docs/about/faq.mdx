# Frequently Asked Questions

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you get started with
Tigris.

## Why does Tigris use the AWS CLI and SDKs?

Tigris is a globally distributed object storage system that is compatible with
[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This allows you to use familiar S3-based
tools like the AWS CLI and SDKs to interact with Tigris, all you have to do is
tell them to use the Tigris endpoint URL and Tigris credentials instead of using
AWS. This also means that if the project or tool you're using works with S3, it
will work with Tigris
[as long as it uses calls that Tigris supports](/docs/api/s3/).

S3 is the standard object storage protocol, and it's widely supported by the
industry at large. By supporting the S3 API, Tigris can be used with a wide
variety of tools and libraries without requiring any changes. All you need to do
is change out the endpoint and credentials.

Most applications stick to a very limited subset of the S3 API (typically
`GetObject`, `PutObject`, `ListObjectsV2`, `DeleteObject`, `HeadObject`, and
[presigned URLs](/docs/objects/presigned/)), so in practice, most applications
should work with Tigris without any changes.

## Is Tigris a CDN?

Tigris has a lot in common with
[Content Delivery/Distribution Networks (CDNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
and you can create your own CDN on top of Tigris, but it is not a CDN per se.
Tigris is a globally distributed object storage system that moves files around
the globe to be close to your users. This is similar to what a CDN does, but
Tigris is a general-purpose object storage system. You can use Tigris to store
and serve any kind of file (text, images, videos, invoice PDFs, AI training
data, AI models, etc.), not just web content. There are no restrictions on what
types of files you can store in Tigris.
