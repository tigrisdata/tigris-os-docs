# About Tigris Data

## What is Tigris?

Tigris is a globally distributed, S3-compatible object storage service. Tigris
stores and retrieves objects with automatic multi-region replication, a single
global endpoint, and no egress fees.

Tigris fulfills over 90% of the AWS S3 API, including the most commonly used
operations, and can replace AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloudflare R2 for
many object storage workloads.

## Our Mission

Tigris Data was founded in 2022 by
[Ovais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovaistariq/),
[Himank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-chaudhary-1937b958/), and,
[Yevgeniy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efirsov/) with the mission of simplifying
object storage for developers.

## Our Expertise

Before starting Tigris Data, the founders spent almost six years working closely
together at Uber, where they built and operated Uber's global storage platform,
leading projects such as
[Docstore](https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://eng.uber.com/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://eng.uber.com/dbevents-ingestion-framework/).

This experience building petabyte-scale distributed storage systems at Uber
provides deep expertise in:

- **Multi-region replication** and data consistency
- **High availability** storage architectures
- **S3-compatible APIs** and tooling
- **Performance optimization** for object storage

Our experiences have given us a lot of important lessons. We've learned about
the importance of making architectural choices that can scale, establishing
efficiency as a core principle, hiring the right talent, and cultivating a
culture that supports diversity, innovation, and growth.
