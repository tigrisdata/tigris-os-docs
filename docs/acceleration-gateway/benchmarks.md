# Benchmarks

Benchmark results for a single TAG instance serving cached object reads. A
single TAG node saturates a 100 Gbps NIC at ~85+ Gbps for objects 1 MiB and
larger, delivers ~75K ops/sec for small objects, and maintains low single-digit
millisecond TTFB — all while using around 12% of available CPU.

## Test environment

Benchmarks were run on Amazon EC2 using
[go-ycsb](https://github.com/pingcap/go-ycsb) and
[warp](https://github.com/minio/warp).

| Role             | Instance      | vCPUs | Memory  | Storage   | Network  |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Benchmark client | c6in.16xlarge | 64    | 128 GiB | —         | 100 Gbps |
| TAG server       | i3en.24xlarge | 96    | 768 GiB | 60 TB SSD | 100 Gbps |

TAG was run as a single instance via `native/run.sh`. During the benchmarks, TAG
CPU usage stayed under 1200% and memory usage remained around 24 GB, leaving
significant headroom on the server.

## Results — warp

Benchmarks were run using [warp](https://github.com/minio/warp). Each test ran
GET operations for ~30 minutes.

## Key observations

- **1 KiB objects**: ~75K ops/sec at 64 threads with sub-millisecond p50.
- **100 KiB objects**: ~3.2 GiB/s at 64 threads (~26 Gbps).
- **1 MiB objects**: ~10.7 GiB/s (~86 Gbps) at 64 threads, saturating the 100
  Gbps EC2 network link at 32+ threads.
- **4 MiB objects**: ~10.5 GiB/s (~84 Gbps) at 32 threads, saturating the 100
  Gbps EC2 network link.
- TTFB remains sub-millisecond for small objects (1 KiB, 100 KiB) and stays in
  the low single-digit milliseconds for objects up to 4 MiB.
- Throughput scales with thread count for small objects and saturates the 100
  Gbps NIC at ~85 Gbps for 1 MiB+ objects.

## Limitations

For 1 MiB+ objects, throughput is NIC-bound at ~85 Gbps — the practical maximum
on a 100 Gbps EC2 link. For smaller objects (1 KiB, 100 KiB), throughput is
client-bound; multiple benchmark clients would be needed to determine TAG's
actual ceiling. A single go-ycsb instance does not scale well past ~20 Gbps and
struggles with object sizes above 1 MB.
