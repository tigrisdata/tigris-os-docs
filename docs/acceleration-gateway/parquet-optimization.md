# Parquet optimization

TAG can cache a parquet object's **metadata** ahead of the reader that needs it,
so opening a file does not begin with a series of upstream round trips.

It is **off by default**, because whether it helps depends on the shape of your
parquet files. This page explains what it does, how to tell whether it will help
your data, how to turn it on, and how to tell afterwards whether it did.

## Why parquet needs special handling

A parquet reader cannot read any data before it reads the file's metadata, and
that metadata lives at the **end** of the object:

```
┌──────────────────── object ────────────────────┐
│  row groups …          │  metadata  │ L │ PAR1 │
└────────────────────────┴────────────┴───┴──────┘
                                       4B    4B
```

The last 8 bytes are a 4-byte little-endian metadata length followed by the
`PAR1` magic. So a reader always:

1. reads the final 8 bytes to learn how long the metadata is, then
2. reads the metadata region, then
3. reads only the row groups that survive pruning.

Step 2 is on the critical path of every query touching that file. If those bytes
are not cached, the reader waits on object storage before it can look at a
single row.

## What TAG does about it

With block-aligned caching (on by default), an object is cached as fixed-size
blocks of `cache.block_size` — 1 MiB unless you change it. The read in step 1
caches only the block containing the trailer. If the metadata is larger than
that block, the rest of it is **not** cached, and the reader discovers those
blocks as misses.

When `cache.parquet_optimization` is on, TAG fills that gap from two directions:

| Trigger          | Fires when                              | Helps                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `parquet_footer` | a read reaches an object's trailer      | the **second and later** opens      |
| `write_warm`     | a parquet object is written through TAG | the **first** open, before any read |

Both compute the metadata region from the length the file itself declares —
never a guess — and fetch only the blocks it provably spans.

### Why the second trigger exists

The read trigger cannot help a file's first open, because the first read is what
fires it. That matters when writers and readers overlap: an ingest pipeline
writing parquet while a dashboard queries a recent time window re-reads the same
window on every refresh, so every open after the first is already warm, and the
only cold opens are files written since the last refresh. `write_warm` covers
exactly those.

If nothing writes through TAG, or writes and reads are far apart in time,
`write_warm` will do little and `parquet_footer` does the work.

## Will it help my data?

It depends on one thing: **is the metadata bigger than the block that already
gets cached?**

Footer size scales with row groups and columns, because the footer carries
per-column statistics for every row group. A wide schema can put several MB of
metadata on a few-hundred-MB object; a narrow one keeps it under a hundred KB.

The comparison is _not_ footer size against `block_size`. It is footer size
against the **tail block**, which is usually a partial block:

```
tail_bytes = ContentLength - floor((ContentLength - 1) / block_size) * block_size
```

That is `ContentLength mod block_size` for most objects — anywhere from 1 byte
to a full block — and exactly `block_size` for an object whose length happens to
be a multiple of it. The prefetch does work whenever:

```
footer_bytes + 8  >  tail_bytes
```

For arbitrarily sized objects the tail averages half a block, so a footer of a
few hundred KB against 1 MiB blocks still fires on a meaningful fraction of
them. Objects that are exact multiples of `block_size` get a full block of
coverage and fire least often.

**To find out for your data**, enable the flag on one node and read the
histogram:

```promql
# Median parquet footer size, in bytes.
histogram_quantile(0.5, sum(rate(tag_cache_parquet_footer_bytes_bucket[1h])) by (le))
```

`tag_cache_parquet_footer_bytes` is recorded for **every** parquet object whose
trailer is read — including ones that are not prefetched — so it describes the
whole population, not just the part that was acted on.

Compare that figure against the **tail block, not `block_size`**. Since the tail
averages half a block across arbitrarily sized objects, `block_size / 2` is the
practical yardstick: a median footer near or above it means the prefetch fires
on a large share of your objects, and a median well below it means this
optimization has little to do and should stay off. Comparing against the full
`block_size` understates how often it fires and will talk you out of a change
worth making.

The exact per-object condition is still `footer_bytes + 8 > tail_bytes`; the
halving is only a way to reason about a whole population from one number.

## Enabling it

```yaml
cache:
  block_caching_enabled: true # required — this builds on block mode
  block_size: 1048576 # the metadata is measured against this
  parquet_optimization: true
```

Or by environment:

```bash
TAG_CACHE_PARQUET_OPTIMIZATION=true
```

The value must be `true` or `1`. **Anything unrecognized leaves it off** — this
is speculative work, so an ambiguous setting is not treated as consent.

It applies to keys ending in `.parquet` (case-insensitive). The suffix is a
hint, not a guarantee: TAG validates the `PAR1` trailer and does nothing if it
is absent, so a non-parquet file with that extension is simply ignored.

:::note

This requires block-aligned caching. With `block_caching_enabled: false`, or a
`block_size` that is not positive, the setting is silently inert — it reads as
enabled and does nothing.

### Related settings

- **`cache.block_size`** — the single most important tuning knob. Size it to
  your reader's read granularity; an oversized block over-fetches on every miss.
  It also sets what counts as "metadata too large to fit", as above.
- **`cache.meta_on_write`** — complementary, not an alternative. It caches an
  object's _metadata entry_ on write so the first read does not spend a round
  trip discovering the object exists. Across a reader's opening sequence,
  `meta_on_write` removes the discovery round trips while footer caching removes
  the block fetches; enabling both takes a cold first open to zero upstream
  requests.

See the [Configuration reference](./configuration.md) for both.

## Checking whether it worked

Measure the **outcome**, not the speculation. The block cache hit ratio is what
actually matters, and it already exists:

```promql
# Block cache hit ratio. Footer caching should raise it, most visibly on first opens.
sum(rate(tag_cache_block_hits_total[30m]))
/
(sum(rate(tag_cache_block_hits_total[30m])) + sum(rate(tag_cache_block_misses_total[30m])))
```

Alongside it, the cost side:

```promql
# How much speculative fetching each trigger is doing.
sum by (trigger) (rate(tag_cache_block_prefetched_total[30m]))
```

A rising hit ratio with modest prefetch volume is the shape you want. Prefetch
volume with no movement in the hit ratio means the speculation is not landing
where reads go, and the trigger should be turned off.

Also worth watching: `tag_cache_parquet_footer_bytes`, the footer distribution.
A shift here means a schema change, and it is worth re-checking that the
optimization still applies.

See the [Metrics reference](./metrics.md) for the full list.

## What it costs, and what bounds it

Fetching metadata is a small fraction of the bytes that caching whole objects
would move, but it is not free. The safeguards:

- **Bounded by the object.** The block range comes from the declared metadata
  length, validated against the object size. A corrupt or impossible length
  prefetches nothing.
- **Capped.** At most 32 blocks per object, so a pathological file cannot evict
  a working set.
- **Shed, not queued.** Fetches take the populate memory budget non-blocking, so
  under load prefetching is dropped rather than competing with reads that
  clients are waiting on.
- **Skips what is cached.** Blocks already present are never re-fetched.
- **Coalesced.** One scan per object version at a time, with a short cooldown
  afterwards, so a hot object is not re-examined on every read.
- **Off the request path.** Both triggers fire after the response is committed,
  so neither adds latency to the request that fired it.

## Turning it off

Set `cache.parquet_optimization: false`, or remove it. Both triggers stop;
nothing needs to be rolled back, and blocks already cached remain valid and are
served normally.
