# Billing

Tigris follows a [usage-based pricing](../pricing/) model, so you are only
charged for the resources you use. All charges are billed in USD on a monthly
basis, following a calendar month billing cycle. Invoices are generated at the
end of each billing period and are due upon issuance. You are required to have a
valid payment card on file, which will be charged automatically when the invoice
is issued. Charges are calculated based on your actual usage each month. You can
view and download your invoices directly from the Dashboard. Supported payment
methods are listed below.

## Monitor usage

You can easily monitor your organization’s usage and spending in the Dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev).
2. Go to **Usage** in the left-hand navigation bar.
3. View your current month’s usage and total charges on the main page.
4. To see usage for previous months, use the timeframe selector in the top right
   corner.

This helps you track your resource consumption and manage costs effectively.
