# Bucket Settings

The Tigris dashboard lets you configure various settings for your buckets.
Here's an overview of the settings you can configure:

- Bucket Sharing: Share buckets between your organization members or outside
  collaborators.
- Public / Private Access: Set the default access rules for a bucket.
- Storage Tier: Set the storage tier for a bucket.
- Custom Domains: Configure a custom domain to serve your bucket content.
- Object Notifications: Subscribe to events on your buckets.
- Data Migration: Migrate data from one bucket to another.
- Region Restriction: Restrict the regions where your bucket data is stored.
- Cache Control: Set the default `Cache-Control` header for objects in the
  bucket.
- Additional Headers: Configure implicit response headers for objects stored in
  your buckets.
- TTL Configuration: Set the default time-to-live (TTL) for objects in the
  bucket.
- CORS Configuration: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for
  your bucket.
- Delete This Bucket: Permanently delete a bucket.

## Sharing

![Bucket Sharing](./sharing-buckets.webp)

You use Bucket Sharing to share buckets between your organization members or
outside collaborators. For more information, please see the bucket sharing page:
[Bucket Sharing](/docs/buckets/sharing/).

## Public / Private Access

![Bucket default access](./bucket-default-acl.webp)

Tigris lets you control the [access rules](/docs/buckets/public-bucket/) for a
bucket. This section lets you set the default access rules for a bucket (either
public or private). You can optionally enable "Allow Object ACL" to let you
customize public/private status
[for individual objects](/docs/objects/acl/#applying-acls-to-objects).

## Storage Tier

This is set on bucket creation and cannot be changed. For more information,
please see the storage tiers page: [Storage Tiers](/docs/objects/tiers/).

## Custom Domains

![Custom domain settings](./bucket-custom-domain.webp)

You can configure a custom domain to serve your bucket content. For more
information see the [Custom Domain](/docs/buckets/custom-domain/) documentation.

The custom domain name must match the bucket name. For example, if the custom
domain is `foo.example.com`, the bucket name must be `foo.example.com`.

## Object Notifications

![Object Notifications](./object-notifications.webp)

Object notifications allow you to subscribe to events on your buckets. For more
information see the [object notifications](/docs/buckets/object-notifications/)
documentation. You can configure the following settings:

- Webhook URL: The URL to send the notification to.
- Authentication type: None, token or password.
- Filter: SQL style filtering for objects.

Tigris will notify you on the following events:

- New objects being put into buckets.
- Existing objects being deleted from buckets.

## Data Migration

![Shadow bucket migration](./shadow-bucket-migration.webp)

You can migrate data from one bucket to another using the
[data migration](/docs/migration/) feature. This will automatically copy data
that isn't in Tigris over to Tigris when it's needed. Tigris implements the
following migration strategy:

1. When an object is requested, it is served from your Tigris bucket if it is
   found.
2. If the object is not found in Tigris bucket, the object will be returned from
   your source bucket and asynchronously copied to Tigris.
3. All other operations, including put and delete, continue to work as usual

If you enable the write-through option, Tigris will write the object to your
source bucket and Tigris bucket at the same time. This is useful for keeping
your source bucket in sync with Tigris.

## Region Restriction

![Region restriction](./region-restriction.webp)

You can restrict the regions where your bucket data is stored. This is useful
for compliance with data protection regulations. For more information see the
[region restriction](/docs/objects/object_regions/) documentation.

## Cache Control

![Cache control](./cache-control.webp)

This lets you set the default `Cache-Control` header for objects in the bucket.
Tigris will set some
[cache control headers by default](/docs/objects/caching/#cache-headers) for
public objects, but you can set an implicit default here.

## Additional Headers

![Bucket additional headers](./bucket-additional-headers.webp)

You can configure additional headers for objects stored in your buckets. This
can be useful when your tools set incorrect headers or you need to set custom
headers. Right now the only setting implemented is to set the
`X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff`, which prevents browsers from
performing "content sniffing" and guessing the MIME type of the content based on
the content itself.

## TTL Configuration

![TTL Configuration](./ttl-configuration.webp)

You can set the default time-to-live (TTL) for objects in the bucket. This is
useful for buckets that contain ephmemeral data that should be deleted after a
certain period of time. For more information see the
[Object Expiration](/docs/buckets/objects-expiration/) documentation.

You can configure the following modes:

![TTL configuration: delete anything older than a given date](./ttl-configuration-prune.webp)

You can configure Tigris to delete anything older than a given date. This lets
you clean up a bucket by deleting old data on the server side.

![TTL configuration: delete anything older than a given duration](./ttl-configuration-maxage.webp)

You can also configure Tigris to automatically delete any object older than a
given number of days.

## CORS Configuration

![CORS Configuration](./cors.webp)

You can configure
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
rules for your bucket. This allows you to have a website dynamically fetch data
from Tigris. For more information see the
[CORS Configuration](/docs/buckets/cors/) documentation.

## Delete This Bucket

![Delete bucket](./bucket-goodbye.webp)

You can delete a bucket by clicking the "Delete Bucket" button. This will
permanently delete all objects in the bucket. This action cannot be undone.

When you delete a bucket, its name will become unavailable for reuse for a few
minutes while the deletion is processed. If you try to create a new bucket with
the same name during this time, you will receive an error.
