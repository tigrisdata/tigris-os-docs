Tigris CLI provides a simple and powerful command line interface to manage your
Tigris resources such as buckets, objects, and access keys.

Get started with Tigris CLI by installing it globally using npm:

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @tigrisdata/cli
```

### Usage

```bash
tigris <command> [flags]
```

Run `tigris help` to see all available commands, or `tigris <command> help` to
get details on a specific command.

### Authentication

The quickest way to get started is to login via your browser:

```bash
tigris login
```

This opens a browser window for OAuth authentication. Once complete, your
session is active and you can start using all commands. If you have multiple
organizations, you'll be prompted to select one.

To login with an access key and secret instead:

```bash
tigris login credentials --access-key <your-key> --access-secret <your-secret>
```

Sessions created with `tigris login` are temporary — they are cleared when you
run `tigris logout`.

Sessions created with `tigris login oauth` will automatically expire in about an
hour. If you need to end such a session sooner, run tigris logout.

To save credentials permanently so they persist across sessions:

```bash
tigris configure --access-key <your-key> --access-secret <your-secret>
```

This writes your credentials to `~/.tigris/config.json`. After configuring, all
commands work automatically without needing to login each time.

You can verify your authentication status at any time:

```bash
tigris whoami
```

To test that your credentials have access to a specific bucket:

```bash
tigris credentials test
tigris credentials test --bucket my-bucket
```
