# Mixpeek

Mixpeek is a multimodal platform that provides a semantic layer that works
out-of-the box. Connect your Tigris bucket to Mixpeek, and it lets you
automatically index and search across text, images, audio, video, and other file
types using natural language and vector similarity. It connects to your object
storage (like Tigris) to perform data extraction, generate embeddings, and
enable semantic queries—by default, with no additional configuration. With
Tigris, your data is globally replicated and instantly available via a simple
S3-compatible API, making it easy for Mixpeek to keep everything indexed and
searchable in real time.

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- Connected Mixpeek to your Tigris bucket
- Uploaded files for indexing
- Performed a multimodal search over your stored content

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Tigris object storage bucket already created
- Your Tigris access key and secret
- A Mixpeek account and API key

## 1. Set Environment Variables

Start by setting your credentials and endpoint information in your environment:

```bash
export MIXPEEK_API_KEY=<your_mixpeek_api_key>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_tigris_access_key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_tigris_secret_key>
export AWS_REGION=auto
export AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
export BUCKET_NAME=<your_bucket_name>
```

## 2. Initialize Mixpeek with Tigris Storage

Use the Mixpeek Python SDK to register your Tigris bucket as a storage source:

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek
import os

mp = Mixpeek(api_key=os.getenv("MIXPEEK_API_KEY"))

mp.set_storage(
    name="tigris-bucket",
    type="s3",
    endpoint=os.getenv("AWS_S3_ENDPOINT"),
    access_key=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    secret_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
    region=os.getenv("AWS_REGION")
)
```

## 3. Upload Files to Tigris

Mixpeek can automatically index files you upload to your bucket. Here’s how to
upload via the SDK:

```python
mp.upload(
    bucket="tigris-bucket",
    key="datasets/report.pdf",
    metadata={"project": "Q3 Analysis", "type": "report"}
)
```

## 4. Run a Multimodal Search

Once your files are indexed, you can search across them using natural language:

```python
results = mp.search("PDFs with revenue graphs and charts")
for result in results:
    print(result["key"], result["score"])
```

You can combine semantic search with metadata filtering and keyword matching to
fine-tune results.

## You Did It!

You now have a working integration between Tigris and Mixpeek.

- Files uploaded to your Tigris bucket are automatically indexed
- Vector embeddings and metadata are extracted behind the scenes
- You can search across text, images, audio, video, and more using natural
  language
