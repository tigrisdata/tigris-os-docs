# Creating an Access Key

Clients need access keys to store files on Tigris. You can mint new access keys
from the [Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev).

First, go to the [Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev).

Give the key a name and assign the desired permissions. If you're unsure, you
can always come back and edit the permissions later. Some common permissions to
give:

- Admin access for your developer machine (not recommended for production)
- Read-only access to all buckets
- Editor access to a specific bucket or set of buckets (such as a bucket for a
  specific project or service)

Copy the credentials to your notes or password manager. You will not be able to
see them again. Then you can use them with [any tools you want](/docs/sdks/s3/).
