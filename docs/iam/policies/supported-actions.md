# Full List of Supported S3-Compatible IAM Actions

This page lists all `s3:`-prefixed IAM actions supported by Tigris for use in
IAM policies.

Tigris is S3-compatible and supports a rich subset of the AWS S3 IAM action
model. These actions can be used within the `Action` field of your IAM policy
statements.

You can:

- Use exact action names (e.g. `s3:PutObject`)
- Use wildcards (e.g. `s3:Get*` or `s3:*`)
- Mix with conditions and resource ARNs for fine-grained access control
