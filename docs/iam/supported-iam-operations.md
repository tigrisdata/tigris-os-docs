# Supported IAM Operations

Tigris supports a subset of IAM operations that are commonly used for managing
permissions. The following operations are supported:

| Operation           | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| IAM:CreateAccessKey | Creates a new access key for a user. |
| IAM:ListAccessKeys  | Lists all access keys for a user.    |
| IAM:UpdateAccessKey | Updates a specific access key.       |
| IAM:DeleteAccessKey | Deletes a specific access key.       |

You can conveniently
[create and manage access keys using the Tigris Dashboard](/docs/iam/create-access-key/index.mdx).
