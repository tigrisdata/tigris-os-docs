The HTTP streaming remote MCP server for Tigris lets you use Tigris in your
agentic workflows without having to install additional software to your machine.
Among other things, this enables your agents to access Tigris even if they are
web agents such as ChatGPT.

### Goose (CLI)

:::note

Due to [a bug in Goose](https://github.com/block/goose/issues/6073), you need to
use the [`mcp-remote` NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to
mediate access to the Tigris MCP server. This represents a different security
threat model than other clients employ. Please consult with your local systems
administrator if you need a better understanding of the risks involved.

```sh
goose configure
```
