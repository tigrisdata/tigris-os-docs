# Using model weights in Tigris anywhere with fly.io

The most common way to deploy AI models in production is by using “serverless”
inference. This means that every time you get a request, you don’t know what
state the underlying hardware is in. You don’t know if you have your models
cached, and in the worst case you need to do a cold start and download your
model weights from scratch.

A couple fixable problems arise when running your models on serverless or any
frequently changing infrastructure:

- Model distribution that's not optimized for latency causes needless GPU idle
  time as the model weights are downloaded to the machine on cold start. Tigris
  behaves like a content delivery network by default and is designed for low
  latency, saving idle time on cold start.
- Compliance restrictions like data sovereignty and GDPR increase complexity
  quickly. Tigris makes regional restrictions a one-line configuration, guide
  [here](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/objects/object_regions/).
- Reliance on third party caches for distributing models creates an upstream
  dependency and leaves your system vulnerable to downtime. Tigris guarantees
  99.99% availability with
  [public availability data](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/availability-metrics-public/).

## Fly.io

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) is a modern public cloud with datacentres all over the
world. Some datacentres include GPU machines. For more information about using
GPUs on fly.io, check out
[their documentation on how to do this](https://fly.io/docs/gpus/getting-started-gpus/).

Coincidentally, all of the regions that Fly.io has GPUs in also have Tigris in
them, so pulling models is very fast (network line rate fast in many cases). You
can use [our discount code](https://fly.io/hello/tigris) to complete this
blueprint on us.

## Usecase

You can put AI model weights into Tigris so that they are cached and fast no
matter where you’re inferencing from. This allows you to have cold starts be
faster and you can take advantage of Tigris'
[globally distributed architecture](/docs/overview/), enabling your workloads to
start quickly no matter where they are in the world.

For this example, we’ll set up
[SDXL Lightning](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning) by ByteDance
for inference with the weights stored in Tigris.

## Getting Started

Download the `sdxl-in-tigris` template from GitHub:

```text
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/sdxl-in-tigris
```

<details>
<summary>Prerequisite tools</summary>

In order to run this example locally, you need these tools installed:

- Python 3.11
- pipenv
- The AWS CLI

Also be sure to configure the AWS CLI for use with Tigris:
[Configuring the AWS CLI](/docs/sdks/s3/aws-cli/).

To build a custom variant of the image, you need these tools installed:

- Mac/Windows:
  [Docker Desktop app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/),
  alternatives such as Podman Desktop will not work.
- Linux: Docker daemon, alternatives such as Podman will not work.
- [Replicate's cog tool](https://github.com/replicate/cog)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

To install all of the tool depedencies at once, clone the template repo and run
`brew bundle`.

</details>

Create a new bucket for generated images, it’ll be called `generated-images` in
this article.

```text
aws s3 create-bucket --acl private generated-images
```

<details>
<summary>Optional: upload your own model</summary>

If you want to upload your own models, create a bucket for this. It'll be
referred to as `model-storage-demo` in this tutorial.

Both of these buckets should be private.

Then activate the virtual environment with `pipenv shell` and install the
dependencies for uploading a model:

```text
pipenv shell --python 3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the `prepare_model` script to massage and upload a Stable Diffusion XL model
or finetune to Tigris:

```text
python scripts/prepare_model.py ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning model-storage-demo
```

:::info

Want differently styled images? Try finetunes like
[Kohaku XL](https://huggingface.co/KBlueLeaf/Kohaku-XL-Zeta)! Pass the Hugging
Face repo name to the `prepare_model` script like this:

```text
python scripts/prepare_model.py KBlueLeaf/Kohaku-XL-Zeta model-storage-demo
```

:::

</details>

## Access keys

Create a new access key in the [Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev).
Don't assign any permissions to it.

Copy the access key ID and secret access keys into either your notes or a
password manager, you will not be able to see them again. These credentials will
be used later to deploy your app in the cloud. This keypair will be referred to
as the `workload-keypair` in this tutorial.

[Limit the scope of this access key](/docs/iam/limited-access-key) to only the
`model-storage-demo` (or a custom bucket if you're uploading your own models)
and `generated-images` buckets.

## Deploying it to Fly.io

<details>
<summary>Optional: building your own image</summary>

In order to deploy this, you need to build the image with the cog tool. Log into
a Docker registry and run this command to build and push it:

```text
cog push your-docker-username/sdxl-tigris --use-cuda-base-image false
```

Replace `yasomimi/sdxl-tigris` in the below examples with your docker
repository.

</details>

Every fly.io resource lives inside an "app". Create a new app for this to live
in:

```text
fly apps create your-app-name-here
```

As a reminder, this example is configured with environment variables. Set the
following environment variables in your deployments:

|             Envvar name | Value                                                              |
| ----------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The access key ID from the workload keypair                        |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The secret access key from the workload keypair                    |
|   `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` | `https://t3.storage.dev`                                   |
|            `AWS_REGION` | `auto`                                                             |
|            `MODEL_PATH` | `ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning`                                         |
|     `MODEL_BUCKET_NAME` | `model-storage-demo` (Optional: replace with your own bucket name) |
|    `PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME` | `generated-images` (replace with your own bucket name)             |

Then create a GPU machine with an l40s GPU in it in Seattle:

```text
fly machine run \
  -a your-app-name-here \
  --name sdxl-lightning \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<workload-keypair-access-key-id> \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<workload-keypair-secret-access-key> \
  -e AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://t3.storage.dev \
  -e AWS_REGION=auto \
  -e MODEL_BUCKET_NAME=model-storage-demo \
  -e PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME=generated-images \
  -e MODEL_PATH=ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning \
  --vm-gpu-kind l40s \
  -r sea \
  yasomimi/sdxl-tigris:latest:latest \
  -- python -m cog.server.http --host ::
```

This will print a machine IP like this:

```text
Machine started, you can connect via the following private ip
  fdaa:0:641b:a7b:165:347b:d972:2
```

Then proxy to the machine:

```text
fly proxy -a your-app-name-here \
  5001:5000 \
  fdaa:0:641b:a7b:165:347b:d972:2
```

Then you need to wait a few minutes while the machine sets itself up. It's done
when it prints this line in the logs:

```text
{"logger": "cog.server.probes", "timestamp": "2024-10-22T17:36:06.651457Z", "severity": "INFO", "message": "Not running in Kubernetes: disabling probe helpers."}
```

Do a test generation with this curl command:

```text
curl "http://localhost:5001/predictions/$(uuidgen)" \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary '{
    "input": {
        "prompt": "The space needle in Seattle, best quality, masterpiece",
        "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
        "guidance_scale": 3.5,
        "num_inference_steps": 4,
        "max_sequence_length": 512,
        "output_format": "png",
        "num_outputs": 1
    }
}'
```

If all goes well, you should get an image like this:

![The word 'success' in front of the Space Needle](./success.webp)

You can destroy the machine with this command:

```text
fly machine destroy --force -a your-app-name-here sdxl-lightning
```
