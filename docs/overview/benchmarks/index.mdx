# Benchmarks

Tigris is highly optimized for storing and retrieving small objects, offering
significant performance advantages over other popular object storage solutions.

## Performance Highlights

Benchmarks comparing Tigris with AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2 demonstrate that
Tigris consistently delivers higher throughput and lower latency for small
object workloads:

- **Sub-10ms** read latency
- **Sub-20ms** write latency
- **4x throughput** compared to AWS S3 for both read and write operations
- **20x throughput** compared to Cloudflare R2 for both read and write
  operations

## Why Tigris is Fast

Tigris employs several key strategies to accelerate small object workloads:

- **Inlining Small Objects:** Very small objects are inlined directly within
  their metadata records, which minimizes the I/O operations required for
  retrieval.
- **Key Coalescing:** Adjacent keys are coalesced to reduce storage
  fragmentation and overhead, improving data density and scan efficiency.
- **On-Disk Caching:** Frequently accessed ("hot") items are cached in a
  high-performance, on-disk cache backed by a Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM),
  ensuring rapid access to popular data.

This efficiency allows you to use a single, unified object store for a wide
range of object sizes, from very small payloads to large multi-gigabyte blobs,
without performance trade-offs.
