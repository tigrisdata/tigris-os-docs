# Partner Integration Program

Tigris is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any
amount of data without egress fees. As Tigris is S3-compatible, existing S3 SDKs
and tools work simply by configuring them to point to Tigris.

For users who wish to integrate with Tigris to offer object storage as a service
to their customers, there is an additional API for managing billing, buckets,
authorization, and organizations.

The Partner Integrations API supports a variety of use cases where an
application creates and manages access keys, buckets, objects, and user
identities on behalf of end users. For example, a cloud platform that offers
compute may seamlessly extend their offering to include object storage by
integrating via the Partner Integrations API.

The Partner Integration Program is designed to help partners integrate Tigris
with their platforms.

# Getting Started

Tigris, check out the
[Partner Integrations API reference guide](/docs/partner-integrations/api/) for

To kick off a partnership with the Partner Integration Program, reach out to us
at [help@tigrisdata.com](mailto:help@tigrisdata.com). We will provide you with a
signing key that you can use to authenticate your requests and start using the
API.

# Partner Requirements

As a Tigris Partner, you'll need to:

- Provide a unique user identifier per end user for provisioning appropriate
  access controls
- Model your aplication to utilize Tigris Organizations that contain one or more
  Users

You do not need to have a Fly.io account to use the Partner Integrations API.

We'll need to supply you a:

- Provider ID
- Signing key

# White Label Use

Tigris supports custom bucket endpoints for partners. A typical bucket endpoint
looks like `https://tigris-example-bucket.fly.storage.tigris.dev/bar.txt`, and
it can be customized to `https://tigris-example-bucket.<CUSTOM_URL>/bar.txt`

# Identity and Access Management

Our goal is to provide simple and effective access controls.

Organizations provide strong isolation between end users. An organization is
created for each end user, and an organization may consist of one or more users.
A user may have `Admin` or `Member` privileges.

Endpoints for rotating and revoking access keys are available, as well as a
recommended process for off boarding end users. Off boarding consists of
deactivating the organization and its associated access keys.

# Billing

You are able to run your own billing logic. Tigris provides billing totals given
a date range with granularity to the day per organization.
