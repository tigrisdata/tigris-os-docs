# Partner Integration Program

Tigris is a globally-distributed S3-compatible object storage service that
allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data for a wide range of use
cases. Tigris automatically and intelligently manages the storage of data across
multiple regions, providing the best possible performance, durability, and
availability.

As Tigris is S3-compatible, users can continue to use existing AWS S3 SDKs, and
tools to interact with Tigris.

But there are use cases where platforms need to integrate with Tigris Object
Store to provide a seamless experience to their users. An example of this is
integrating Tigris Object Store with a cloud platform to provide a unified
experience to the end-users. Fly.io is an example of such an integration.

This is exactly why we have launched the Partner Integration Program. The
Partner Integration Program is designed to help partners integrate Tigris with
their platforms.
