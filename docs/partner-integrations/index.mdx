# Partner Integration Program

Tigris is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data without egress fees. As Tigris is S3-compatible, existing S3 SDKs and tools work simply by configuring them to point to Tigris.

For users who wish to integrate with Tigris to offer object storage as a service to their customers, there is an additional API for managing billing, buckets, authorization, and organizations.

The Partner Integrations API supports a variety of use cases where an application creates and manages access keys, buckets, objects, and user identities on behalf of end users. For example, a cloud platform that offers compute may seamlessly extend their offering to include object storage by integrating via the Partner Integrations API.

The Partner Integration Program is designed to help partners integrate Tigris with
their platforms.

# Partner Requirements

As a Tigris Partner, you'll need to give us a unique user identifier per end user for provisioning appropriate access controls. You do not need to have a Fly.io account to use the Partner Integrations API.

We'll need to supply you a:
- Provider ID
- Signing key

# White Label Use

Tigris supports custom bucket endpoints for partners. A typical bucket endpoint looks like `https://tigris-example-bucket.fly.storage.tigris.dev/bar.txt`, and it can be customized to `https://tigris-example-bucket.<CUSTOM_URL>/bar.txt`

# Billing

You are able to run your own billing logic. Tigris provides billing totals given a date range with granularity to the day.
