# Partner Integration Program

Tigris is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any
amount of data without egress fees. As Tigris is S3-compatible, existing S3 SDKs
and tools work simply by configuring them to point to Tigris.

For partners who wish to integrate with Tigris to offer object storage as a
service to their customers, there is an additional API for managing billing,
buckets, authorization, and organizations.

The Partner Integrations API is designed for **platforms and SaaS applications**
that want to offer object storage to their users. Consider the Partner
Integration Program if:

| ✅ Good fit                                                      | ❌ Not a fit                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| You're building a platform that provisions storage for end users | You just need storage for your own application            |
| You need to track usage and bill customers separately            | You only need a single bucket for your team               |
| You want to automate tenant onboarding via API                   | You prefer manual bucket management via dashboard         |
| You require strong isolation between customers                   | Shared access with bucket-level permissions is sufficient |

**Examples of good use cases:**

- **Cloud platforms** extending their offering to include object storage
- **Developer tools** that need per-user or per-project storage
- **AI/ML platforms** providing model and dataset storage per customer
- **Content platforms** isolating media storage per tenant
- **Backup services** managing storage on behalf of end users

If you just need object storage for your own application, check out our
[Getting Started Guide](/docs/get-started) instead.

## Getting Started

Ready to integrate? Here's how to begin:

1. **Understand the architecture** - Read our
   [Multi-Tenant Architecture guide](/docs/partner-integrations/architecture) to
   learn how to map your customers to Tigris Organizations
2. **Review the API** - Explore the
   [Partner Integrations API reference](/docs/partner-integrations/api/) for
   authentication and endpoints
3. **Contact us** - Email [help@tigrisdata.com](mailto:help@tigrisdata.com) to
   kick off your partnership. We'll provide your Provider ID and signing key.

## White Label Use

Tigris supports custom bucket endpoints for partners. A typical bucket endpoint
looks like `https://tigris-example-bucket.t3.storage.dev/bar.txt`, and it can be
customized to `https://tigris-example-bucket.<CUSTOM_URL>/bar.txt`

## Identity and Access Management

Our goal is to provide simple and effective access controls.

Organizations provide strong isolation between end users. An organization is
created for each end user, and an organization may consist of one or more users.
A user may have `Admin` or `Member` privileges.

Endpoints for rotating and revoking access keys are available, as well as a
recommended process for off boarding end users. Off boarding consists of
deactivating the organization and its associated access keys.

## Billing

You are able to run your own billing logic. Tigris provides billing totals given
a date range with granularity to the day per organization.
