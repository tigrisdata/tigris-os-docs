## Getting Started with Bufstream on Tigris

(Bufstream)[https://buf.build/product/bufstream] is the Kafka-compatible message
queue built for the data lakehouse era. It's a drop-in replacement for Apache
Kafka®, but instead of requiring expensive machines with large attached disks,
Bufstream builds on top of off-the-shelf technologies like Object Storage and
Postgres, providing a Kafka implementation designed for the cloud-native era.

Tigris is a globally distributed, multi-cloud object storage platform with
native S3 API support and zero egress fees. It dynamically places data in the
region where it’s being accessed—eliminating cross-cloud data transfer costs
without sacrificing performance.

When you combine the two, you get unlimited message retention and truly global
operation. Combining zero egress fees with typed streams means that your
applications can scale across the globe fearlessly.

## Parts overview

(Bufstream)[https://buf.build/product/bufstream] is a fully self-hosted drop-in
replacement for Apache Kafka® that writes data to S3-compatible object storage.
It’s 100% compatible with the Kafka protocol, including support for exactly-once
semantics (EOS) and transactions. Bufstream is more cost-effective to operate,
and a single cluster can elastically scale to hundreds of GB/s of throughput
without sacrificing performance. It's the universal Kafka replacement for the
modern age.

Even better, for teams sending Protobuf messages across their Kafka topics,
Bufstream can enforce data quality and governance requirements on the broker
with [Protovalidate](https://protovalidate.com/). Bufstream can even store
topics as [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/) tables, reducing
time-to-insight in popular data lakehouse products like Snowflake and
ClickHouse.

To interact with Bufstream, we’ll use Kafkactl, a CLI tool for interacting with
Apache Kafka and compatible tools.

In addition, we’ll use Docker, the universal package format for the Internet.
Docker lets you put your application and all its dependencies into a container
image so that it can’t conflict with anything else on the system.

## Pre-reqs

- (Docker Desktop)[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/] or a similar
  app, like (Podman Desktop)[https://podman-desktop.io/].
- A Tigris account; if you don’t have one, you can create one at storage.new.

## Clone the example repo

Clone the bufstream-tigris demo repo to your laptop and open it in your editor
of choice. You’ll come back to it later to add configuration details.

## Create a Tigris bucket

Create a new bucket at (storage.new)[https://storage.new/] in the Standard
access tier. Copy its name down into your notes. You’ll need it later for
configuration.

Create a new (access key)[https://storage.new/accesskey] with Editor permissions
for that bucket. Open the .env file included in the repository and add the
access key ID and secret access key values to the block shown below:

````bash
# Add your Tigris access key ID and its secret below.
TIGRIS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
TIGRIS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

## Configure Bufstream for Tigris
Open the bufstream.yaml file, and add your bucket’s name beside the bucket: key. Leave region set to auto so that Tigris routes to the closest region:
```yaml
storage:
  provider: S3
  region: auto
  bucket: # Add your Tigris bucket name here.
  endpoint: <https://t3.storage.dev>
  # Don't update these: they're references to environment variable names.
  access_key_id:
    env_var: TIGRIS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key:
    env_var: TIGRIS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
````

We’re ready to start Bufstream and begin writing data to Tigris!

## Start Bufstream

Start the environment, using -d to run the Compose project in detached mode,
returning your to a prompt after all services start.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should see the following output:

```text
 ✔ Network bufstream-on-tigris_bufstream_net  Created                          0.0s
 ✔ Container cli                              Started                          0.3s
 ✔ Container postgres                         Healthy                         10.9s
 ✔ Container bufstream                        Started                         11.1s
```

##Create a topic Use kafkactl to create a Kafka topic in Bufstream. In your
terminal, run the following:

```bash
docker exec cli kafkactl create topic bufstream-on-tigris
```

````text
When it completes, you’ll see the following output:
```text
topic created: bufstream-on-tigris
````

##Produce to the topic Now that you’ve created a topic, let’s write some data.
In the example repo, we’ve included a sample message in messages.txt. Run the
following in your terminal:

```bash
docker exec cli kafkactl produce bufstream-on-tigris --file=/messages.txt
```

````text
When it’s done, you’ll see the following message:
7 messages produced
```text

## Consume messages
Let’s read the messages back. Consume the last 100 messages from the topic:
```bash
docker exec cli kafkactl consume bufstream-on-tigris --tail=100
````

You’ll see the seven messages from messages.txt that were published to the
topic:

```text
Hello, world!
This
is
Bufstream
running
on
Tigris!
```

It works! You’ve successfully produced data to a topic and then consumed it.
From here, you can rest easy knowing that Tigris securely backs up your data,
and you can access it from anywhere in the world. If you open your Tigris
console to the bucket you created, you’ll see Bufstream’s added a number of keys
to store your topic data. Feel free to keep using kafkactl—or your own code—to
add more messages and topics, keeping an eye on the bucket for changes.
