# DuckDB Quickstart

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) is an in-process embedded analytical database
optimized for fast queries, ease of use, and embedding efficient analytics
inside existing applications. It's the SQLite for analytics, but with a stronger
focus on data analytics, aggregation, and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
queries.

To get started using DuckDB with Tigris, you need to do the following things:

- Create new bucket at [storage.new](https://storage.new) if you don't have one
- Create an access keypair for that bucket at
  [storage.new/accesskey](https://storage.new/accesskey)
- Configure DuckDB to use Tigris
- Query files in Tigris

## (**OPTIONAL**) Create a new bucket

Open [storage.new](https://storage.new) in your web browser.

Give your bucket a name and select what [storage tier](../objects/tiers.md) it
should use by default. As a general rule of thumb:

- Standard is the default. If you're not sure what you want, pick standard.
- Infrequent Access is cheaper than Standard, but charges per gigabyte of
  retrieval.
- Instant Retrieval Archive is for long-term storage where you might need urgent
  access at any moment.
- Archive is for long-term storage where you don't mind having to wait for data
  to be brought out of cold storage.

Click "Create".

## Create an access keypair for that bucket

Open [storage.new/accesskey](https://storage.new/accesskey) in your web browser.

Give the keypair a name. This name will be shown in your list of access keys, so
be sure to make it descriptive enough that you can figure out what it's for
later.

You can either give this key access to all of the buckets you have access to or
grant access to an individual bucket by name. Type the name of your bucket and
give it Editor permissions.

Click "Create".

Copy the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and other values into a safe place
such as your password manager. Tigris will not show you the Secret Access Key
again.

## Configure DuckDB to use Tigris

Open the DuckDB command line in your terminal:

```text
$ duckdb
v1.2.2 7c039464e4
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
D
```

Create a new secret with the `CREATE SECRET` command:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SECRET tigris
  ( TYPE s3
  , PROVIDER config
  , KEY_ID 'tid_access_key_id'
  , SECRET 'tsec_secret_access_key'
  , REGION 'auto'
  , ENDPOINT 't3.storage.dev'
  , URL_STYLE 'vhost'
  );
```

## Query files in DuckDB

Once you're in, you can query files in your bucket like you would normally, just
open them with the `s3://<bucketname>` prefix:

```sql
SELECT * FROM
  READ_JSON
    ( 's3://xe-duckdb/*.json'
    , columns =
      { request_date: 'struct("seconds" bigint, "nanos" bigint)'
      , response_time: 'struct(nanos bigint)'
      , host: 'varchar'
      , "method": 'varchar'
      , path: 'varchar'
      , headers: 'map(string, string)'
      , remote_ip: 'varchar'
      , request_id: 'uuid'
      }
    );
```
