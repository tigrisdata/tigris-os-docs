# iPython / Jupyter Quickstart

To get started using your iPython notebooks with Tigris, you can check out our
[example notebook](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/ipython-notebooks/blob/main/quickstart.ipynb)
or
[run it on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AFr9vyERpQWhdXbLt-wrLNH7w7N4SbzI).

To run it you will need the following:

1. A [Tigris account](https://storage.new/)
2. An [access keypair](https://storage.new/accesskey)
3. A computer running Python 3.10 (or later) that has internet access (OS and
   CPU architecture does not matter)
4. A tigris bucket
5. The
   [uv python environment manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

If you are running this notebook in an environment such as Google Colab, uv will
be installed for you and all you need are your Tigris credentials.

First, install
[boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html), the
library for accessing object storage from Python programs:

```sh
uv pip install boto3
```

Then set your access key details in the notebook environment:

```python
import os

# Replace these with the access key ID and secret access key
# from the access key creation modal dialog box.
os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = 'tid_access_key_id'
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = 'tsec_secret_access_key'

# Leave these at the default settings.
os.environ['AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3'] = 'https://t3.storage.dev'
os.environ['AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_IAM'] = 'https://iam.storage.dev'
os.environ['AWS_REGION'] = 'auto'
```

Or if you have
[AWS profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
configured, change the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to point to the
profile you want to use:

```python
import os

os.environ['AWS_PROFILE'] = 'tigris'
```

Then create a storage client:

```python
import boto3
from botocore.client import Config

# Create object storage service client
svc = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='https://t3.storage.dev',
    config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
)
```

And list buckets:

```python
response = svc.list_buckets()

for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'  {bucket["Name"]}')
```

Create a `bucket_name` alias to make it easier to interact with Tigris:

```python
bucket_name = bucket_name = os.getenv('TIGRIS_BUCKET', 'xe-tigris-test2') # Replace your bucket name here
```

Or make a new bucket if you don't have one:

```python
svc.create_bucket(
    ACL='private',
    Bucket=bucket_name,
)
```

Then upload a file:

```python
with open('test.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hi there, this is a test!\n')

svc.upload_file('test.txt', bucket_name, 'notebook/test.txt')
```

And grab it back:

```python
svc.download_file(bucket_name, 'notebook/test.txt', 'test2.txt')
```

Make sure the files match:

```sh
ls *.txt
cat test.txt
cat test2.txt
```

Finally, generate a
[presigned URL](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/objects/presigned/) to share it
with a friend:

```python
url = svc.generate_presigned_url(
    'get_object',
    Params={'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': 'notebook/test.txt'},
    ExpiresIn=604800
)

print(f'Presigned URL to download an object: {url}')
```
