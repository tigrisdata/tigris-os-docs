# rclone Quickstart

Tigris is a globally distributed S3-compatible object storage service that
provides high-performance object storage with automatic multi-region replication
and zero egress fees. [rclone](https://rclone.org/) is an open-source command
line tool that lets you manage objects in Tigris, AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox,
and [many other storage providers](https://rclone.org/#providers) with the same
S3-compatible interface. rclone has built-in support for encrypting your
objects, managing versioned backups, incrementally transferring only what
changed, and even mounting your cloud object storage to your computer like a
virtual flash drive.

To get started uploading objects to Tigris using rclone, you need to do the
following things:

- Create a new bucket at [storage.new](https://storage.new)
- Create an access keypair for that bucket at
  [storage.new/accesskey](https://storage.new/accesskey)
- Configure rclone to use Tigris
- Upload files to Tigris

## 1. Create a new bucket

Open [storage.new](https://storage.new) in your web browser.

Give your bucket a name and select what [storage tier](../objects/tiers.md) it
should use by default. As a general rule of thumb:

- Standard is the default. If you're not sure what you want, pick standard.
- Infrequent Access is cheaper than Standard, but charges per gigabyte of
  retrieval.
- Instant Retrieval Archive is for long-term storage where you might need urgent
  access at any moment.
- Archive is for long-term storage where you don't mind having to wait for data
  to be brought out of cold storage.

Click "Create".

## 2. Create an access keypair for that bucket

Open [storage.new/accesskey](https://storage.new/accesskey) in your web browser.

Give the keypair a name. This name will be shown in your list of access keys, so
be sure to make it descriptive enough that you can figure out what it's for
later.

You can either give this key access to all of the buckets you have access to or
grant access to an individual bucket by name. Type the name of your bucket and
give it Editor permissions.

Click "Create".

Copy the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and other values into a safe place
such as your password manager. Tigris will not show you the Secret Access Key
again for security purposes.

## 3. Configure rclone to use Tigris

Open a terminal and run `rclone config`:

```text
$ rclone config
o remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
```

Create a new remote with `n`:

```text
Enter name for new remote.
name>
```

Name it `tigris`.

Choose the "Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers" provider.

```text
 4 / Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers including AWS, Alibaba, ArvanCloud, Ceph, ChinaMobile, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Dreamhost, GCS, HuaweiOBS, IBMCOS, IDrive, IONOS, LyveCloud, Leviia, Liara, Linode, Magalu, Minio, Netease, Outscale, Petabox, RackCorp, Rclone, Scaleway, SeaweedFS, Selectel, StackPath, Storj, Synology, TencentCOS, Wasabi, Qiniu and others
   \ (s3)
...
Storage> 4
```

Select "Any other S3 compatible provider":

```text
34 / Any other S3 compatible provider
   \ (Other)
provider> 34
```

Enter AWS credentials in the next step.

```text
 1 / Enter AWS credentials in the next step.
   \ (false)
env_auth> 1
```

Copy the Access Key ID from your password manager, paste it into the terminal,
and hit enter.

```text
access_key_id> tid_samplesampledocstest
```

Copy the Secret Access Key from your password manager, paste it into the
terminal, and hit enter.

```text
secret_access_key> tsec_samplesampledocstest_hunter2
```

Enter the region `auto`:

```text
region> auto
```

Enter the endpoint `https://t3.storage.dev`:

```text
endpoint> https://t3.storage.dev
```

Skip the location constraint by pressing enter.

Skip the canned ACL by pressing enter.

Skip editing advanced config by pressing enter.

Read over the configuration options you set and confirm with `y`:

```text
Keep this "tigris" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

To confirm things are working, list your buckets with `rclone lsd tigris:`

```text
$ rclone lsd tigris:
[...]
          -1 2025-05-01 14:20:48        -1 example-bucket
```

## 4. Upload files to Tigris

Finally, upload a big file to rclone with `rclone copy`:

```text
$ rclone copy /path/to/bigfile.tar.gz tigris:example-bucket/bigfile.tar.gz
```

Make sure it's there with `rclone ls`:

```text
$ rclone ls tigris:example-bucket/
5460387840 bigfile.tar.gz
```

And that's it! You've successfully configured rclone to manage your objects on
Tigris! For further customization, advanced configuration options, or
troubleshooting, refer to the
[official rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/). Happy copying!
