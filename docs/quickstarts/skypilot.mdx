# SkyPilot Quickstart

Tigris is a globally distributed S3-compatible object storage service with zero
egress fees and automatic multi-region replication.
[SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/index.html) is an
open-source framework for running AI and batch workloads on any infrastructure
provider, anywhere. Flexibly provision compute in any cloud with the same common
configuration—no switch statements or analyzing instance types.

Tigris enables this extreme portability by globally distributing your objects so
they're always close to the compute SkyPilot dynamically provisions. Since
Tigris has zero egress fees, you don't have to worry about additional costs by
going multi-cloud. Your data is automatically replicated to regions close to
where it's accessed, reducing latency for compute workloads.

## How to install SkyPilot

There's a few ways to set up SkyPilot, here's the easiest methods:

### Conda

If you already use [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), follow the
[upstream guide](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
on how to install SkyPilot. Make sure to install the adaptor for your
infrastructure:

```sh
pip install "skypilot[aws]"
pip install "skypilot[kubernetes]"
# ...
```

Or mix and match:

```sh
pip install -U "skypilot[kubernetes,aws,gcp]"
```

### How to use Docker to run SkyPilot

If you want to skip the grind and just get started, run this `docker` command to
set up SkyPilot in a container:

```text
# NOTE: '--platform linux/amd64' is needed for Apple silicon Macs
docker run --platform linux/amd64 \
  -td --rm --name sky \
  -v "$HOME/.sky:/root/.sky:rw" \
  -v "$HOME/.aws:/root/.aws:rw" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud:rw" \
  berkeleyskypilot/skypilot
```

Then open a shell with `docker exec`:

```text
docker exec -it sky /bin/bash
```

## How to use Tigris with SkyPilot

If you're running a training job or storing model weights, reference these
guides:

- [Using model weights in Tigris anywhere with SkyPilot](/docs/model-storage/skypilot.mdx)
- [Training with Big Data on SkyPilot](/docs/training/big-data-skypilot/index.mdx)

Otherwise, use
[boto3 to interact with Tigris](/docs/sdks/s3/aws-python-sdk.mdx):

```python
# Create S3 service client
svc = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='https://t3.storage.dev',
    config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
)

# List buckets
response = svc.list_buckets()

for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'  {bucket["Name"]}')

# List objects
response = svc.list_objects_v2(Bucket='tigris-example')

for obj in response['Contents']:
    print(f'  {obj["Key"]}')

# Upload file
response = svc.upload_file('getting-started.py', 'tigris-example', 'getting-started.py')

# Download file
response = svc.download_file('tigris-example', 'getting-started.py', 'getting-started-2.py')
```

Now you have SkyPilot installed with Tigris. Enjoy building!
