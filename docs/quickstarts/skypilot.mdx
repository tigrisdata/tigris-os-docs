# SkyPilot Quickstart

[SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/index.html) is an
open-source framework for running AI and batch workloads on any infrastructure
provider, anywhere. Flexibly provision compute in any cloud with the same common
configuration-- no switch statements or analyzing instance types.

Tigris enables this extreme portability by globally distributing your data so
it's always close to the compute SkyPilot dynamically provisions. Since Tigris
is a no egress fee storage provider, you don't have to worry about additional
costs by going multi-cloud.

## How to install SkyPilot

There's a few ways to set up SkyPilot, here's the easiest methods:

### Conda

If you already use [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), follow the
[upstream guide](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
on how to install SkyPilot. Make sure to install the adaptor for your
infrastructure:

```sh
pip install "skypilot[aws]"
pip install "skypilot[kubernetes]"
# ...
```

Or mix and match:

```sh
pip install -U "skypilot[kubernetes,aws,gcp]"
```

### How to use Docker to run SkyPilot

If you want to skip the grind and just get started, run this `docker` command to
set up SkyPilot in a container:

```text
# NOTE: '--platform linux/amd64' is needed for Apple silicon Macs
docker run --platform linux/amd64 \
  -td --rm --name sky \
  -v "$HOME/.sky:/root/.sky:rw" \
  -v "$HOME/.aws:/root/.aws:rw" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud:rw" \
  berkeleyskypilot/skypilot
```

Then open a shell with `docker exec`:

```text
docker exec -it sky /bin/bash
```

## How to use Tigris with SkyPilot

If you're running a training job or storing model weights, reference these
guides:

- [Using model weights in Tigris anywhere with SkyPilot](/docs/model-storage/skypilot.mdx)
- [Training with Big Data on SkyPilot](/docs/training/big-data-skypilot/index.mdx)

Otherwise, use
[boto3 to interact with Tigris](/docs/sdks/s3/aws-python-sdk.mdx):

```python
# Create S3 service client
svc = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='https://t3.storageapi.dev',
    config=Config(s3={'addressing_style': 'virtual'}),
)

# List buckets
response = svc.list_buckets()

for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f'  {bucket["Name"]}')

# List objects
response = svc.list_objects_v2(Bucket='tigris-example')

for obj in response['Contents']:
    print(f'  {obj["Key"]}')

# Upload file
response = svc.upload_file('getting-started.py', 'tigris-example', 'getting-started.py')

# Download file
response = svc.download_file('tigris-example', 'getting-started.py', 'getting-started-2.py')
```

Now you have SkyPilot installed with Tigris. Enjoy building!
