# ExAWS Elixir SDK

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

This guide assumes that you have followed the steps in the
[Getting Started](/docs/get-started/index.md) guide, and have the access keys
available.

You may continue to use the ExAWS SDK as you normally would, but with the
endpoint set to Tigris. If you are using Tigris outside of Fly, use the endpoint
[https://t3.storage.dev](https://t3.storage.dev). If you are using Tigris from
within Fly, use the endpoint [https://t3.storage.dev](https://t3.storage.dev).

This example reads the credentials from the environment variables
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

## ExAWS configuration

### Dependencies

Add the dependencies to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:ex_aws, "~> 2.0"},
      {:ex_aws_s3, "~> 2.0"},
      {:poison, "~> 3.0"},
      {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
      {:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6.6"},
      {:jason, "~> 1.1"},
    ]
  end
```

### Development configuration

Now setup the configuration for ex_aws and ex_aws_s3 in your `dev.exs` file (or
`config/config.exs` file):

import configEXS from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/elixir/config/config.exs";

<CodeBlock language="elixir">{configEXS}</CodeBlock>

In the first config we configure :ex_aws, by setting the access_key_id and
secret_access_key. In this case we use AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables to store the access keys we will use
to access Tigris.

Then we configure the S3 API endpoint, which is "t3.storage.dev".

### Runtime configuration

Now similar to above, let's add the configuration in `runtime.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config

if config_env() == :prod do

  # ....
  # Configure S3 client for access to Tigris
  config :ex_aws,
    debug_requests: true,
    json_codec: Jason,
    access_key_id: {:system, "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"},
    secret_access_key: {:system, "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"}

  config :ex_aws, :s3,
    scheme: "https://",
    host: "t3.storage.dev",
    region: "auto"

end
```

## Example

import gettingStarted from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/elixir/examples/getting_started.ex";

<CodeBlock language="elixir">{gettingStarted}</CodeBlock>

## Using presigned URLs

Presigned URLs can be used with the ExAWS SDK as follows:

import presignedUrls from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/elixir/examples/presigned_urls.ex";

<CodeBlock language="elixir">{presignedUrls}</CodeBlock>

### Presigned URLs with custom domains

You can also use a
[presigned URL with a custom domain](../../objects/presigned.md#presigned-url-with-custom-domain)
by replacing the Tigris domain name with your custom domain name:

```elixir
branded_url = String.replace(presigned_url, "t3.storage.dev", "your-domain.example.com")
IO.puts("Presigned URL for GET (custom domain): #{branded_url}")
```
