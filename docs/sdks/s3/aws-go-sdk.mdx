# AWS Go SDK

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

This guide assumes that you have followed the steps in the
[Getting Started](/docs/get-started/index.md) guide, and have the access keys
available.

You may continue to use the AWS Go SDK as you normally would, but with the
endpoint set to Tigris. If you are using Tigris outside of Fly, use the endpoint
[https://t3.storageapi.dev](https://t3.storageapi.dev). If you are using Tigris
from within Fly, use the endpoint
[https://fly.storage.tigris.dev](https://fly.storage.tigris.dev).

This example uses the [AWS Go SDK v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2) and
reads the default credentials file or the environment variables
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

When you create your client, make sure to enable the following settings:

- `BaseEndpoint` should be set to `https://t3.storageapi.dev`.
- `Region` should be set to `auto`.
- `UsePathStyle` should be set to `false`.

```go
svc := s3.NewFromConfig(sdkConfig, func(o *s3.Options) {
  // highlight-start
  o.BaseEndpoint = aws.String("https://t3.storageapi.dev")
  o.Region = "auto"
  o.UsePathStyle = false
  // highlight-end
})
```

## Getting started

This shows off a few basic operations with the AWS Go SDK such as PutObject,
ListObjectsV2, and GetObject.

import gettingStarted from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/getting-started/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{gettingStarted}</CodeBlock>

Run it with:

```sh
go run main.go bucket-name
```

## Conditional operations

Below is an example of how to use the AWS Go SDK to
[perform conditional operations](/docs/objects/conditionals.md) on objects in
Tigris. The example reads an object, modifies it, and then writes it back to the
bucket. The write operation is conditional on the object not being modified
since it was read.

import conditionalOperations from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/conditional-operations/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{conditionalOperations}</CodeBlock>

Run it with:

```sh
go run main.go bucket-name
```

## Using presigned URLs

Presigned URLs can be used with the AWS Go SDK as follows:

import presignedUrls from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/presigned-urls/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{presignedUrls}</CodeBlock>

You can now use the URL returned by the `presignedPutReq.URL` and
`presignedGetReq.URL` to upload or download objects.

Run it with:

```sh
go run main.go bucket-name
```

:::note

When you use presigned URLs, you must disable path-style requests in your S3 SDK
configuration.

This will generate a virtual-hosted-style URL that is compatible with Tigris.

:::

### Presigned URLs with custom domains

You can also use a
[presigned URL with a custom domain](../../objects/presigned.md#presigned-url-with-custom-domain)
by replacing the Tigris domain name with your custom domain name:

```go
brandedURL := strings.ReplaceAll(presignedGetReq.URL, "tigris-example.t3.storageapi.dev", "your-domain.example.com")
fmt.Printf("Presigned URL for GET (custom domain): %s\n", brandedURL)
```

## Object Regions

Below is an example of how to use the AWS Go SDK to restrict
[object region](/docs/objects/object_regions) to Europe only (`fra` region).

import objectRegions from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/object-regions/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{objectRegions}</CodeBlock>

Run it with:

```sh
go run main.go bucket-name
```

## Metadata Querying

Below is an example of how to use
[metadata querying](/docs/objects/query-metadata) with the AWS Go SDK.

import metadataQuerying from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/metadata-querying/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{metadataQuerying}</CodeBlock>

## Object Notifications

If you want to be notified when an object is created or deleted in a bucket, use
[object notifications](/docs/buckets/object-notifications). This example shows
you how to implement a server that listens for and parses object notifications
so you can take action when an object is created or deleted.

import webhook from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/webhook/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{webhook}</CodeBlock>

## Renaming Objects

To rename an object using the AWS Go SDK, attach the `X-Tigris-Rename: true`
header to a CopyObject request.

import renameObject from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/go/cmd/rename-objects/main.go";

<CodeBlock language="go">{renameObject}</CodeBlock>
