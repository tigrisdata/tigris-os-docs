# AWS JavaScript SDK

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

This guide assumes that you have followed the steps in the
[Getting Started](/docs/get-started/index.md) guide, and have the access keys
available.

You may continue to use the AWS JS SDK as you normally would, but with the
endpoint set to `https://fly.storage.tigris.dev`. Also make sure that
`s3ForcePathStyle` is set to `false`.

```js
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const S3 = new S3Client({
  region: "auto",
  endpoint: "https://fly.storage.tigris.dev",
  // highlight-start
  s3ForcePathStyle: false,
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Getting started

This example uses the
[AWS Node.js SDK v3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-s3) and reads
the default credentials file or the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

import gettingStarted from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/js/getting-started.js";

<CodeBlock language="js">{gettingStarted}</CodeBlock>

## Using presigned URLs

Presigned URLs can be used with the AWS Node.js SDK as follows:

import presignedUrls from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/js/presigned-urls.js";

<CodeBlock language="js">{presignedUrls}</CodeBlock>

You can now use the URL returned by the `getSignedUrl` function to download or
upload objects to the bucket using the `https` package.
