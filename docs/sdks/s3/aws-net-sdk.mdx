# AWS .Net SDK

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

This guide assumes that you have followed the steps in the
[Getting Started](/docs/get-started/index.md) guide, and have the access keys
available.

You may continue to use the AWS .Net SDK as you normally would, but with the
endpoint set to Tigris. If you are using Tigris outside of Fly, use the endpoint
[https://t3.storageapi.dev](https://t3.storageapi.dev). If you are using Tigris from
within Fly, use the endpoint
[https://fly.storage.tigris.dev](https://fly.storage.tigris.dev).

This example uses the
[AWS .Net SDK v3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.S3) and reads the
default credentials file or the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Install the SDK from nuget:

```text
dotnet add package AWSSDK.S3
dotnet add package AWSSDK.SecurityToken
dotnet add package AWSSDK.SSO
dotnet add package AWSSDK.SSOOIDC
```

Then you can use the SDK as you normally would, but with the endpoint set to
Tigris. If you are using Tigris outside of Fly, use the endpoint
[https://t3.storageapi.dev](https://t3.storageapi.dev). If you are using Tigris from
within Fly, use the endpoint
[https://fly.storage.tigris.dev](https://fly.storage.tigris.dev).

:::note

Tigris currently does not support chunk encoding. You must set
`UseChunkEncoding` to `false` in the `PutObjectRequest`.

import putObject from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/dotnet/PutObject.csx";

<CodeBlock language="csharp">{putObject}</CodeBlock>

## Pre-signed URLs

Using Tigris with the .NET SDK is easy with one small change. The .Net SDK
defaults to using v2 signatures, Tigris only supports v4 signatures. In order to
use pre-signed URLs, you must set `UseSignatureV4` to `true` in the global
`AWSConfigsS3` object in the Amazon namespace.

```csharp
using Amazon;

AWSConfigsS3.UseSignatureVersion4 = true;
```

import presignedUrl from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/dotnet/PresignedURL.csx";

<CodeBlock language="csharp">{presignedUrl}</CodeBlock>

### Presigned URLs with custom domains

You can also use a
[presigned URL with a custom domain](../../objects/presigned.md#presigned-url-with-custom-domain)
by replacing the Tigris domain name with your custom domain name:

```csharp
string brandedURL = presignedUrl.Replace("t3.storageapi.dev", "your-domain.example.com");
Console.WriteLine($"Presigned URL for GET (custom domain): {brandedURL}");
```
