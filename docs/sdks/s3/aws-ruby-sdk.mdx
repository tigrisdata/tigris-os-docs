# AWS Ruby SDK

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

This guide assumes that you have followed the steps in the
[Getting Started](/docs/get-started/index.md) guide, and have the access keys
available.

You may continue to use the AWS Ruby SDK as you normally would, but with the
endpoint set to `https://fly.storage.tigris.dev`.

This example uses the [AWS Ruby SDK v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby) and
reads the default credentials file or the environment variables
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

import Gemfile from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/ruby/Gemfile";

<CodeBlock language="ruby">{Gemfile}</CodeBlock>

Then you can use the SDK as you normally would, but with the endpoint set to
`https://fly.storage.tigris.dev`.

import gettingStarted from "!!raw-loader!../../../examples/ruby/getting_started.rb";

<CodeBlock language="ruby">{gettingStarted}</CodeBlock>
