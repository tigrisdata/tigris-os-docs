# Client Uploads

Amongst all the other great features of Tigris, free egress fees is another
example of what makes us stand out from other providers. We care about the
bandwidth costs and we want to make it as cheap as possible for you to use
Tigris. That's why we've made it so that you can upload files directly to Tigris
from the client side.

We leverage the
[presigned URLs](/docs/sdks/tigris/using-sdk#presigning-an-object) features to
allow you to upload files directly to Tigris from the client side.

Client side uploads are a great way to upload objects to a bucket directly from
the browser as it allows you to upload objects to a bucket without having to
proxy the objects through your server saving costs on bandwidth.

## Uploading an object

You can use the `upload` method from `client` package to upload objects directly
to Tigris from the client side.

```ts
import { upload } from "@tigrisdata/storage/client";
```

`upload` accepts the following parameters:

- `path`: (Required) A string specifying the path to the object
- `body`: (Required) A blob object as File or Blob
- `options`: (Optional) A JSON object with the following optional parameters:

#### `options`

| **Parameter**    | **Required** | **Values**                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| url              | No           | The URL to upload the file to.                                                                              |
| access           | No           | The access level for the object. Possible values are `public` and `private`.                                |
| onUploadProgress | No           | Callback to track upload progress: `onUploadProgress({loaded: number, total: number, percentage: number})`. |
| config           | No           | A configuration object to override the [default configuration](/docs/sdks/tigris/using-sdk#authentication). |

In case of successful upload, the `data` property will be set to the upload and
contains the following properties:

- `contentDisposition`: content disposition of the object
- `contentType`: content type of the object
- `modified`: Last modified date of the object
- `path`: Path to the object
- `size`: Size of the object
- `url`: A presigned URL to the object

### Example

```html
<input type="file" onchange="handleFileChange(event)" />

<script>
  function handleFileChange(event) {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    upload("file.txt", file, {
      url: "/api/upload",
      access: "private",
      multipart: true,
      onUploadProgress: ({ loaded, total, percentage }) => {
        console.log(`Uploaded ${loaded} of ${total} bytes (${percentage}%)`);
      },
    });
  }
</script>
```
