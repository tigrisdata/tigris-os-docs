# Snapshots and Forks

With Tigris, you can instantly create an isolated, zero-copy clone of your data
for development, testing, or experimentation. You can also access a prior state
of your entire bucket to recover from mistakes or analyze historical states.

## What are snapshots and forks?

Tigris snapshots and forks bring Git-style workflows to your data:

- **[Snapshots](/docs/snapshots)** capture the state of an entire bucket at a
  specific point in time—immutable, instant, and zero-copy.
- **[Forks](/docs/forks)** clone a bucket from a snapshot or the current state,
  sharing objects by reference with zero copying.

Forked buckets are isolated. Their timelines diverge from the source bucket at
the moment of the fork. It's like forking a Git repository.

## How snapshots and forks work together

A snapshot captures a point-in-time view; a fork uses that snapshot as its
starting point. When you create a fork, Tigris either uses a snapshot you
specify or automatically creates one from the current bucket state.

| Concept  | What it is                        | What you do with it                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Snapshot | Immutable point-in-time record    | Read from it, or use it to seed a fork        |
| Fork     | New bucket seeded from a snapshot | Write to it, experiment, then keep or discard |

## Why this matters

Traditional object storage forces a tradeoff: share buckets and risk corruption,
or copy them and pay for expensive duplication. Tigris's append-only
architecture eliminates this tradeoff:

- **Snapshots are O(1)** because they capture references, not data.
- **Forks are instant** because they share objects until modified.
- **Version-based consistency** means readers never block writers.
- **You only pay for changes**, nothing additional for the shared baseline data.

## Next steps

- [Snapshots](/docs/snapshots) — freeze bucket state for versioning, auditing,
  and recovery
- [Forks](/docs/forks) — isolated copies for testing, agents, and
  experimentation
- [Enable and manage snapshots and forks on buckets](/docs/buckets/snapshots-and-forks)
- [Use the Tigris SDK for snapshots and forks](/docs/sdks/tigris/snapshots-and-forks)
