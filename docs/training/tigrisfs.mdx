# Mount Tigris as a Filesystem

For AI workloads, most runtimes assume data is accessible via a filesystem. By
mounting a Tigris bucket as a filesystem, data is no longer limited by local
storage nor memory capacity.

We provide [TigrisFS](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs) a fork of the
original [yandex-cloud/geesefs](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs) project
with optimizations for Tigris. TigrisFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that mounts
S3-compatible storage as a local filesystem. You can use TigrisFS to mount any
Tigris bucket as if it was a normal Linux filesystem.

:::note

TigrisFS does not obfuscate the objects in the bucket, and does not require an
additional metadata service (unlike JuiceFS). This means you can access the
objects directly via the S3-compatible API using the standard S3 SDKs, tools,
and libraries, as well as via the TigrisFS filesystem.

:::

## Prerequisites:

- A Tigris account
- A bucket you want to mount into your system (`mybucket`)
- A target location you want to mount your bucket to (`~/data`)

:::note

TigrisFS uses
[FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html) to mount
buckets into the filesystem. FUSE has limitations involving multiple users
accessing the same mountpoint. If you need multiple users (human or service) to
access the same bucket, consider creating multiple systemd services mounting the
bucket in each user's home directory.

## Installing TigrisFS

Download the latest release for your machine from
[the list of TigrisFS releases](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs/releases)

<details>
<summary>Debian Linux</summary>

You may need to install FUSE utils (fuse3 or fuse RPM/Debian package) first.

```shell
wget https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs/releases/download/v1.2.1/tigrisfs_1.2.1_linux_amd64.deb
dpkg -i tigrisfs_1.2.1_linux_amd64.deb
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>MacOS ARM64</summary>

You may need to install osxfuse/macfuse first.

```shell
curl -sL https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigrisfs/releases/download/v1.2.1/tigrisfs_1.2.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</details>

## Configure credentials

Create a new access key with edit permissions on your target bucket in the
[Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev/). Configure the aws-cli to
utilize the credentials as described in the guide
[here](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/s3/aws-cli/).

## Mount bucket

### Using systemd

When installed from the DEB or RPM package, TigrisFS installs a systemd service
to simplify mounting and configuration.

Mount as current user:

```bash
systemctl --user start tigrisfs@<bucket>
```

Mount as root:

```bash
systemctl start tigrisfs@<bucket>
```

The bucket is mounted at `$HOME/mnt/tigrisfs/<bucket>` for the current user, or
`/mnt/tigrisfs/<bucket>` for root.

To automount the bucket at boot or user login, enable the systemd service:

```bash
systemctl enable tigrisfs@<bucket> # as root
systemctl --user enable tigrisfs@<bucket> # as current user
```

### Using the command line

To mount the bucket using the command line, run the following command:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/tigrisfs <bucket> <mountpoint>
```

You did it! You now have a performant filesystem backed by bottomless object
storage.
